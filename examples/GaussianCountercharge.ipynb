    "\n",
    "Ths workchain implements a correction to the supercell energy based on an equivalent electrostatic model. Normally, this lower-level workchain need not be used directly as the higher-level `FormationEnergy` workchain will abstract the detail away and automate the generation of the necessary inputs. For completeness, and to give the option to use the correction directly, the use of the workchain is demonstrated below."

    "### model_iterations_required\n",
    "`model_iterations_required` sets the number of model supercells to compute. By default, 3 such models are computed.\n",
    "These are one model with scale factor 1, i.e. the current size of input supercell, a model with scale factor 2, i.e. double the size of the current supercell (~8 times the volume), and one with a scale factor of 3 (triple the size, ~27 times larger volume). Increasing the number of iterations required increases the expense of the work chain by introducing larger and larger model supercells, but improves the quality of the fitting for the energy of the isolated supercell (i.e. an infinitiely large supercell giving the defect in the dilute limit). \n",
    "In principle, the default of 3 is already adequate for a decent fit, but this can and should be tested. \n",
    "In the future, the scaling may not be sequential as it is now, but may instead try to favour more 'spaced-out' supercells.\n",

    "`cutoff` sets the planewave cutoff (in Rydberg) for the planewave basis used in the electrostatic model and sets the resolution of the grids used. \n",
    "The modelled interaction (q/r) is smooth and so good results are possible at the default of 40 Ry. In principle, increasing this value improves the accuracy of the results, in exchange for increased computational expense, but equally, the overall method has low sensitivity to this parameter.\n"
