Quick Setup 
=============
The latest stable version of AiiDA-Defects can be downloaded and installed 
directly from the PyPi repository from a shell by simply running:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install aiida-defects

This will install all of the prerequisites automatically in your environment, 
including AiiDA core, if it not already installed. 
Ideally however, you should install AiiDA-Defects after installing and setting 
up AiiDA core.
