The documentation can be built by running here::

    make html

This will create HTML docs that can be viewed in 
your web browser at {aiida-defects path prefix}/docs/build/html/index.html
This requires that aiida-defects is installed, as well as the optional docs dependencies::
    
    pip install -e aiida-defects[docs]
