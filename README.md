Welcome to AiiDA-Defects
========================

AiiDA-Defects is a plugin for the [AiiDA](http://www.aiida.net/) computational materials science framework, and provides tools and automated workflows for the study of defects in materials.

The package is available for download from [GitHub](http://github.com/aiida-defects).

If you use AiiDA-Defects in your work, please cite:

*AiiDA-defects: An automated and fully reproducible workflow for the complete characterization of defect chemistry in functional materials* 
[doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.12465 (preprint)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.12465)

Please also remember to cite the [AiiDA paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00638-4).


Quick Setup
===========

Install this package by running the following in your shell:

    $ pip install .

This will install all of the prerequisites automatically (including for the optional docs) 
in your environment, including AiiDA core, if it not already installed. 


Getting Started
===============

Expample usage of the workchains is documented in the collection of Jupyter notebooks in the ``examples`` directory.
